Google_Sheets Readme

This is a SUPER simple repo regarding how to use Python to connect with and perfrom CRUD (create, Read, Update, Delete) actions to Google Sheets Using the Google API Dashboard. Basically, Using Google Sheets as a database for Web Scraping, Automation, Data Science or even Web Applications. 

At my current position, we used Google Sheets for a ton of our  day-to-day business functions. Most of our business processes are eventually going to be implemented in Microsoft Dynamics with custom action sets that are being created, however, there is a major project I am going to be overtaking - Website Migrations - moving content, images and multiple blog posts / listings from an older website platform too a new one. Having the ability to create, read, update and delete speardsheets is going to be vital. (As is scraping the contents of those specific elements - but that's for another project). So, this is just the basics on connecting to Google Sheets using Python for now. The next steps are: 

1) Logging into Client accounts and using Python for webscraping the pertinent info
2) Using the knowledge frmo this tutorial to update Sheets with that info
3) Using the data stored in the Sheet to populate the client's new account. 
4) Automating that process 
5) Increasing the scope so that the entire process chain from end to end is kicked off when a Client submits a simple form.
